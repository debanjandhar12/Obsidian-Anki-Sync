# Obsidian Anki Sync - Yet another anki plugin

This plugin allow you to make flashcards in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and sync them to [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/).

This project has been inspired from [Obsidian_to_Anki](https://github.com/Pseudonium/Obsidian_to_Anki). However, this is not a fork and hence, this plugin uses a different and more powerful markup based syntax for making flashcards.

## Examples

```markdown
<!-- replaceblock-start -->
<!-- replace id="1" text="Opposite" -->
$$\sin \theta = \frac{Opposite}{Hypotenuse}$$
<!-- replaceblock-end -->
```

There are many **other ways** to create cards using this plugin. See [Tutorial](https://github.com/debanjandhar12/Obsidian-Anki-Sync/blob/main/docs/Tutorial.md) for details and more examples.

## Features

- 📘 **Adding cards to user-specified deck** on a *per-file* or *per-block* basis.
- 📂 Ignore template folders.
- ❔ Cloze **within Latex Math and Code Blocks** by using [replaceblock](https://github.com/debanjandhar12/Obsidian-Anki-Sync/blob/main/docs/replaceblock.md).
- ❔ Cloze by using **highlights** or **anki's cloze syntax** by using [clozeblock](https://github.com/debanjandhar12/Obsidian-Anki-Sync/blob/main/docs/clozeblock.md).

## FAQ

<details>
 <summary>Why yet another plugin for obsidian to anki sync?</summary>
The existing two plugins have a major limitation to implement my workflow 💢. It had no way of creating clozes inside math and code blocks.<br>
This plugin was made with the aim of creating a way to do so.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>How does auto deletation work?</summary>
   First, each card in anki is marked as "created by plugin from this vault" and "not created by plugin from this vault". A card is marked as "created by plugin" if it contains the name of vault as tag, as well as ObsidianAnkiSync tag, as well as the type of note of the card must be of type ObsidianAnkiSyncModel.<br />
   Now, if a card is marked "created by plugin from this vault" but it is not available in the vault, then the card is deleted.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Can i delete or modify the auto-generated oid attribute?
 </summary>
<b>No!</b> Please dont do that. <br /> The plugin uses the oid to track the cards in anki.
Deleting it will cause the plugin to delete the old card and create a new one in Anki. This means that the scheduling information for the card gets deleted if you remove or modify oid.
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Where is the auto anki backup taken before every sync stored?</summary>
In Windows 11, it is stored at:<br />
C:\Users\{WindowsUserName}\AppData\Roaming\Anki2\{AnkiProfileName}
<br><br>
NB: The backup files are stored in a per-deck basis with name ObsidianAnkiSync-Backup-${timestamp}_${deck}.apkg
</details>

<details>
 <summary>Do the auto anki backup also store scheduling information?</summary>
